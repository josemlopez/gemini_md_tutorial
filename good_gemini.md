## What is GEMINI.md and Why It Matters

GEMINI.md is a special Markdown file that serves as a **persistent instruction set** for Google's Gemini CLI. Think of it as your project's AI memory bank - it provides context, rules, and guidance that helps Gemini understand your project's unique requirements and maintain consistency across all interactions.

### Why GEMINI.md is Critical

Without GEMINI.md, Gemini operates on general assumptions, which can lead to:
- Inconsistent code style and architecture decisions
- Misaligned responses that don't match your project's goals
- Repetitive explanations of project context
- Generic solutions that don't fit your specific tech stack

With a well-crafted GEMINI.md, you get:
- **Contextual Accuracy**: Gemini understands your project's purpose and constraints
- **Consistency**: All generated content follows your established patterns
- **Efficiency**: No need to re-explain project basics in every conversation
- **Quality Control**: Built-in guardrails prevent common mistakes

## Understanding the Hierarchical Memory System

Gemini CLI uses a hierarchical approach to load GEMINI.md files, combining context from multiple locations:

```
Loading Order (General → Specific):
1. Global Context: ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md
2. Project Root: ./GEMINI.md (at .git directory level)
3. Subdirectory: ./subdirectory/GEMINI.md
```

### Practical Application

```bash
# Global configuration (applies to all projects)
~/.gemini/GEMINI.md

# Project-specific configuration
my-project/
├── .git/
├── GEMINI.md                    # Project-wide rules
├── frontend/
│   └── GEMINI.md               # Frontend-specific rules
└── backend/
    └── api/
        └── GEMINI.md           # API-specific rules
```

**Key Commands:**
- `/memory show` - View combined context from all loaded files
- `/memory refresh` - Reload all GEMINI.md files

```

### Step 4: Define Clear Boundaries
Set explicit rules for what Gemini should and shouldn't do:

```markdown
## AI Collaboration Rules

**Critical Restrictions:**
- ❌ NEVER modify payment processing logic without explicit approval
- ❌ Do NOT change database schema without migration planning
- ❌ Avoid modifying authentication/authorization without security review

**Standard Practices:**
- ✅ All new components must include TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Use existing UI components from `/components/ui`
- ✅ Follow the established file naming convention
- ✅ Include error boundaries for new page components
```

## Platform-Specific Configurations

### Global Configuration (~/.gemini/GEMINI.md)
Use this for personal preferences and general standards:

```markdown
# Global Gemini CLI Configuration

## General Coding Preferences
- **Communication Style:** Direct and technical, avoid excessive explanations
- **Documentation:** Always include JSDoc comments for functions
- **Testing:** Prefer unit tests over integration tests when possible
- **Dependencies:** Justify new dependencies and check for alternatives

## Language-Specific Rules
**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
- Use 2-space indentation
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use async/await over Promises.then()

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8 strictly
- Use type hints for all function parameters
- Prefer dataclasses over regular classes when appropriate
```

### Project-Level Configuration
Focus on project-specific requirements:

```markdown
# Project: Customer Dashboard

## Business Context
This dashboard serves enterprise customers who manage large-scale operations.
Security and reliability are top priorities.

## Technical Constraints
- Must support IE11 (legacy customer requirement)
- All API calls must include audit logging
- Maximum bundle size: 2MB
- Required accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Integration Requirements
- Uses internal auth service (contact @security-team for changes)
- Connects to legacy SOAP APIs (documentation in /docs/api)
- Must work offline for core features
```

### Component-Level Configuration
For specific modules or components:

```markdown
# Component: Payment Processing Module

## Security Requirements
- All payment data must be encrypted at rest
- PCI DSS compliance required
- No payment information in logs

## Testing Requirements
- Mock all external payment APIs
- Include integration tests with test payment gateways
- Validate all error handling paths

## Dependencies
- Use only approved payment libraries from security team
- Must support Stripe, PayPal, and internal payment processor
```

## Advanced Techniques and Best Practices

### 1. Modular Context with Imports
For large projects, organize GEMINI.md files by importing other Markdown files:

```markdown
# Main GEMINI.md
@architecture.md
@coding-standards.md
@security-guidelines.md

# Project-specific additions
## Current Sprint Goals
- Implement user authentication
- Set up payment processing
- Create admin dashboard
```

### 2. Environment-Specific Instructions
```markdown
## Environment-Specific Guidelines

### Development Environment
- Use `npm run dev` for local development
- Database runs on localhost:5432
- Mock external APIs using MSW

### Production Considerations
- All changes require approval from @senior-dev
- Database migrations must be backward compatible
- No direct database access in production code
```

### 3. Role-Based Instructions
```markdown
## Role-Based Guidelines

### When Acting as Code Reviewer
- Focus on security implications
- Check for proper error handling
- Verify test coverage meets 80% threshold
- Ensure documentation is updated

### When Acting as Bug Fixer
- Always create a test that reproduces the bug first
- Fix root cause, not just symptoms
- Update related documentation
- Consider impact on existing features
```

### 4. Dynamic Context Updates
```markdown
## Current Project State

**Active Sprint:** Authentication Implementation (Week 2 of 3)
**Blockers:** Waiting for security team approval on auth flow
**Next Priority:** Payment integration after auth completion
**Testing Focus:** User registration and login flows

**Updated:** 2025-01-15
**Next Review:** 2025-01-22
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Being Too Vague
❌ **Bad:** "Follow good coding practices"
✅ **Good:** "Use 2-space indentation, prefer const over let, include JSDoc for exported functions"

### 2. Information Overload
❌ **Bad:** Including every possible detail and configuration
✅ **Good:** Focus on what's unique to your project and most likely to cause confusion

### 3. Outdated Information
❌ **Bad:** Leaving old technology versions or deprecated practices
✅ **Good:** Regular updates and version tracking

### 4. Missing Context
❌ **Bad:** "Don't modify the user service"
✅ **Good:** "Don't modify the user service without approval - it's shared with the mobile app and changes require cross-team coordination"

### 5. No Clear Boundaries
❌ **Bad:** General guidelines without specific do's and don'ts
✅ **Good:** Explicit prohibited actions and required practices

## Testing and Optimization

### Validate Your GEMINI.md
Test your configuration by asking Gemini specific questions:

```bash
# Test project understanding
> "Explain the architecture of this project"

# Test coding standards
> "Write a new API endpoint for user registration"

# Test boundaries
> "Should I modify the authentication middleware?"
```

### Iterative Improvement
1. **Monitor Gemini's responses** for consistency with your expectations
2. **Note recurring corrections** you need to make
3. **Update GEMINI.md** to prevent those issues
4. **Review and refine** regularly
